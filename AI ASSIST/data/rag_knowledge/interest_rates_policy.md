# Interest Rates Policy (Structured Knowledge - RAG)

## Scope
This document contains policy-aligned information on interest rates for BFSI products. Do NOT fabricate rates; only use values explicitly stated here or from official sources.

## Interest Rate Framework

### Personal Loans
- **Range:** 10.5% to 24% per annum (varies by credit profile, tenure, amount)
- **Benchmark:** Linked to internal risk-based pricing
- **Fixed vs Floating:** Primarily fixed for personal loans
- **Processing Fee:** 1-2% of loan amount (subject to product)

### Home Loans
- **Range:** 8.5% to 11% per annum (as of policy date)
- **Benchmark:** External benchmark linked (e.g., repo rate + spread) for floating
- **Fixed Rate Option:** Available for select products
- **LTV:** Maximum 80-90% of property value
- **Processing:** 0.5% to 1% of loan amount

### Vehicle Loans
- **Range:** 8.75% to 12% per annum
- **Tenure:** Up to 7 years
- **New vs Used:** Different rates for new and pre-owned vehicles

### EMI Calculation
- Formula: EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1]
- P = Principal, R = Monthly interest rate (annual/12), N = Number of installments
- Interest in initial EMIs is higher; principal component increases over time

### Late Payment
- Late payment charges: As per loan agreement, typically 2-3% of overdue amount
- Grace period: Usually 3 days from due date (product-specific)
- Impact on credit score: Late payments reported to credit bureaus after 30 days overdue
